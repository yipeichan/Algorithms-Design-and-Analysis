1. myCalculator <br>
Task Description<br>
Develop a C++ application (called “myCalculator” perhaps) that, given as input a C/C++ arithmetic expression, (1) converts the input into a postfix expression and prints it out and (2) evaluates the expression and prints out the result. The simplest kind of arithmetic expression that your application must handle is a C/C++ constant integral expression built up from integers and the six arithmetic operators binary + (addition), binary - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division), % (remainder/modulo), and unary - (negation), with possible parentheses ( and ) to group subexpressions. Below are two examples:
•1+2-3*4/5 <br>
• (-1 + 23 - 456) * (78 % 9) <br>
Be careful with illegal inputs. When the input is illegal, your program should be able to report an error and stop (or ask for another input).<br>
You may go beyond these basic requirements for extra credits, but please follow the C/C++ syntax and semantics for integral arithmetic expressions. For instance, you may choose to handle expressions that contain assignments such as:<br>
• (a = 1) + a <br>
• (a = 2) + (bb = a) * bb <br>
